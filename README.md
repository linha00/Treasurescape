<h1 align="center">TREASURESCAPE</h1>
<h3 align="center">TreasureScape aims to help students get acquinted with the nus campus in a fun and engaging way through a game of treasure hunt!</h3>

As freshmen, it was hard for us to navigate the campus efficiently as we were not familiar with the ROUTES AND shortcuts to different locations. This application aims to alleviate this pain point and provide a more seamless navigation experience around the campus.


## Features of our application: 
   1. Live Geolocation of User on the Map
   2. Detection of Treasure
   3. Prize Redemption System
   4. Mission System
   5. Friends Matching System
   6. Augmented Reality 
   7. User Database 

## Use cases:
- As someone new to the campus, I would want to know how to get around campus without getting lost. 

- As a busy NUS student, I would like to know the fastest route to get to class to save time. 

- As a first-year student who is unfamiliar with the campus, I would like to learn more about the different facilities available on campus. 

- As a first-year student entering a new environment, I would be keen on meeting new people.

- As a store vendor, I would want exposure for my store to prospective customers. 

- As a club/organisation, I would want freshmen to know more about what I do so they can turn into prospective members.


## Technologies used:
- React Native
- AWS Amplify

## Currently working on:
1. Looking for better database to suit our needs
2. Geolocation API
3. Augmented Reality API

1. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) for windows or 
```bash
#for linux
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
source ~/.bashrc
volta install node@18
``` 
2. Fork and clone the project
3. Navigate into the project dir using cd
4. Install any nessessory dependency 
```bash

npm install react-hook-form
```
5. Start the program
```bash
npm start
```
6. Scan the QR code or key in the url into expo go app on your phone / simulator

## Branches 
1. Main - the barebone skeleton of the app
2. AWS-backend - AWS amplify installed and linked to AWS server
